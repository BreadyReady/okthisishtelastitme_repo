Marco Diaz is human with moderately close ties to the Butterfly Family. He was part of Star's surrogate family when she transferred to Earth to study magic, and over time the two became romantically involved. While a bit of a scandal, Marco worked hard to earn a place with the royal family. He accompanied Star and the Butterfly family thoughout the numerous political crises that Mewni faced for the past years, starting with the Avarius conflict and through Toffee's attack and Mina's failed coup. He even officially became a knight of Mewni, though he sped through the years-long process in a few months due to his royal relationship. In all respects, he was an embedded friend of the Butterfly family, and if all went well he and Star might even get married. Unfortunately, due to the Cleaving, things wouldn't go well.\n\nAfter Eclipsa's Mewni collapsed and the Mewman crisis began, Marco was taken by a cabal of lower nobles who proclaimed him King against his will. This cabal did this because they wanted a Monarch that that they could comfortably manipulate that was still somewhat related to the Butterfly Family. Marco Diaz, who was largely ignorant of the day-to-day inner workings of Mewman politics, was a good candidate.\n\nThrust into a a position of power he never wanted, it is expected that the cabal puppeting him will eventually dispose of him in favor of more direct control. But some report Marco holding secretive meetings with certian power players in his polity, and many wonder what exactly Marco's true hopes for Mewni are..."
