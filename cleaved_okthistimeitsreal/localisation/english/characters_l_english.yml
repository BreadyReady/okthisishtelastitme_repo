 STA_star_butterfly_desc:0 "§YName:§! Star, Princess of Mewni, Duchess of San Havensisco, Heir to House Butterfly\n§YNicknames:§! Star the Underestimated, Rebel Princess, A Magical Princess From Another Dimension, B-Fly\n§YBirthdate:§! December 22nd, 2000\n§YDescription:§! Star Butterfly was Queen of Mewni for a short but turbulent period before abdicating in favor of Eclipsa. Her reign, and generally her behavior before her reign, was marked less by policy and more by raw energy, impulsive decision-making, and a drive to 'do the right thing' in her eyes. She was instrumental in defeating both Meteora and Mina Loveberry, yet ultimately brought about the Cleaving, merging Earth and Mewni into a new, unstable world order.\n\nAfter the Mewman Crisis shattered the Crownlands, Moon (who is Star's mother), had granted Star a duchy centered around the bay area in order to give her a hands-on learning experience in governance.\n\nStar values freedom, individuality, and optimism, often trying to reconcile Mewman aristocratic traditions with the more egalitarian, liberal ideals she absorbed from Earth. She also believes in furthering monster rights."
 
 MON_moon_butterfly:0 "Moon Butterfly"
 MON_moon_butterfly_desc:0 "§YName:§! Moon, Rightful Queen of Mewni, Rightful Head of House Butterfly\n§YNicknames:§! Moon the Undaunted, Our Lady of Yurt Town\n§YBirthdate:§! ~Mid Novemeber-Mid December, 1980.\n§YDescription:§! Moon was the Queen of Mewni before Elipsa came to power. She had ruled Mewni for years, and had led it to victory in the Septarian War, a war which killed her mother Queen Comet, when she was only 14.\n\nWhen Eclipsa took power, Moon decided against vying for power, mainly because she was still recovering from her disability. She opted instead to tend to a smaller community, Yurt-Town. However, as time went on, she grew bitter and disillusioned to Eclipsa's rule due to the multitude of bad choices Eclipsa made. In fact, Yurt-Town was primarily made up of Mewmans who were dispalced due to Eclipsa's forced property return policy. Moon eventually ended up supporting Mina's coup.\n\nAfter the Cleaving, Moon was one of the first to break away from Eclipsa's declining grasp. Her revolt was a major catalyst for other factions to break away as well.\n\nMoon values stability and strong, authoritative government."

 MEW_eclipsa_butterfly_desc:0 "§YName:§! Eclipsa, Rightful Queen of Mewni, Rightful Head of House Butterfly\n§YNicknames:§! Queen of Darkness, Darkest Star, Monster Lover\n§YBirthdate:§! Chronologically, ~Mid April-Mid May 1695. Biologically, ~Late April-Early May 1986.\n§YDescription:§! Before the Cleaving Eclipsa rose up to the position of Queen through the Meteoran crisis (long story short, the throne went from Moon to Star due to temporary disability, and then the throne went from Star to Eclipsa by Star willingly giving her the throne). Eclipsa's rule was characterized by minor progressive reforms for Monster rights followed by fumbles like the forced return of property to Monsters that Mewman families had lived in for generations, and eventually the political violence of the attempted coup by both the Magic High Commission and Mina Loveberry.\n\nAfter the Cleaving, Eclipsa's grasp on Mewni fully slipped, and various factions broke away from her rule.\n\nEclipsa believes in furthering the rights of Monsters, and also believes in preserving the traditional Mewman way of life and governance while also making things more fair and equitable in her realm."

 MAR_marco_diaz_desc:0 "§YName:§! Marco Ubaldo Diaz\n§YNicknames:§! Marco the Unexpected, Sir Marco of Earth, Safe Kid, Earth Turd\n§YBirthdate:§! November 28th, 2001\n§YDescription:§! Marco Diaz is human with moderately close ties to the Butterfly Family. He was part of Star's surrogate family when she transferred to Earth to study magic, and over time the two became romantically involved. While a bit of a scandal, Marco worked hard to earn a place with the royal family. He accompanied Star and the Butterfly family thoughout the numerous political crises that Mewni faced in the years leading up to the Cleaving, and he officially became a knight of Mewni, though he sped through the years-long process in a few months due to his royal relationship. In all respects, he was an embedded friend of the Butterfly family. Unfortunately, due to the Cleaving, things wouldn't keep going so smoothly.\n\nWhen the Mewman Crisis occured, Marco was taken by a powerful cabal of nobles and was proclaimed king against his will. In the following months, he became the nominal leader of a polity contending to unify the Mewman Crownlands.\n\nMarco, who was born in pre-Cleaved California, believes in American ideals such as freedom, democratic rights, and general liberalism."
 
 HIG_higgs:0 "Captain Higgs"
 HIG_higgs_desc:0 "§YName:§! Captain Higgs of the Mewman Knighthood\n§YNickname(s):§! Higgs the Strong\n§YBirthdate:§! ~Mewman Winter, 2001.\n§YDescription:§! Before the Cleaving, Captain Higgs was a Mewman peasant who rose through the squireship program, quickly proving herself a promising knight’s apprentice. Originally obidient and a model for knightly political fealty, her outlook began to shift when Marco Diaz became a knight at the same time she did by bypassing the years-long squire process through his ties to Star. Shortly before the Cleaving, Higgs abandoned Mewni for the Neverzone, a brutal realm of constant combat. It was there unshackled from aristocratic approval, that she discovered how far raw ability could carry someone of peasant birth.\n\nWhen parts of the Neverzone merged with Earthni during the Cleaving, Higgs returned hardened by the Neverzone and convinced that birthright was meaningless and that true worth came only from blood, sweat, and tears. In the months leading up to the Mewman Crisis, she rallied up her own knightly party without the required approval from royalty. She used this personal army of hers to rob, burn, and terrorize Mewman high society. While not the main cause of Eclipsa losing control over the crownlands, it certainly pushed the process along.\n\n During the crisis, she would go on to sieze territory and become a contender for the Crownlands.\n\n Higgs believes in meritocracy, extreme anti-aristocracy, and military primacy. Her origins in the peasantry is why she does not have a familial house, or a last name as humans would call it."
