 MON_moon_butterfly_desc:0 "§YName:§! Moon, Rightful Queen of Mewni, Rightful Head of House Butterfly\n§YNicknames:§! Moon the Undaunted, Our Lady of Yurt Town\n§YBirthdate:§! ~Mid Novemeber-Mid December, 1980.\n§YDescription:§! Moon was the Queen of Mewni before Elipsa came to power. She had ruled Mewni for years, and had led it to victory in the Septarian War, a war which killed her mother Queen Comet, when she was only 14.\n\nWhen Eclipsa took power, Moon decided against vying for power, mainly because she was still recovering from her disability. She opted instead to tend to a smaller community, Yurt-Town. However, as time went on, she grew bitter and disillusioned to Eclipsa's rule due to the multitude of bad choices Eclipsa made. In fact, Yurt-Town was primarily made up of Mewmans who were dispalced due to Eclipsa's forced property return policy. Moon eventually ended up supporting Mina's coup.\n\nAfter the Cleaving, Moon was one of the first to break away from Eclipsa's declining grasp. Her revolt was a major catalyst for other factions to break away as well.\n\nMoon values stability and strong, authoritative government."

 MEW_eclipsa_butterfly_desc:0 "§YName:§! Eclipsa, Rightful Queen of Mewni, Rightful Head of House Butterfly\n§YNicknames:§! Queen of Darkness, Darkest Star, Monster Lover\n§YBirthdate:§! Chronologically, ~Mid April-Mid May 1695. Biologically, ~Late April-Early May 1986.\n§YDescription:§! Before the Cleaving Eclipsa rose up to the position of Queen through the Meteoran crisis (long story short, the throne went from Moon to Star due to temporary disability, and then the throne went from Star to Eclipsa by Star willingly giving her the throne). Eclipsa's rule was characterized by minor progressive reforms for Monster rights followed by fumbles like the forced return of property to Monsters that Mewman families had lived in for generations, and eventually the political violence of the attempted coup by both the Magic High Commission and Mina Loveberry.\n\nAfter the Cleaving, Eclipsa's grasp on Mewni fully slipped, and various factions broke away from her rule.\n\nEclipsa believes in furthering the rights of Monsters, and also beleives in preserving the traditional Mewman way of life and governance while also making things more fair and equitable in her realm."

 MAR_marco_diaz_desc:0 "§YName:§! Marco Ubaldo Diaz\n§YNicknames:§! Marco the Unexpected, Sir Marco of Earth, Safe Kid, Earth Turd\n§YBirthdate:§! November 28th, 2001\n§YDescription:§! Marco Diaz is human with moderately close ties to the Butterfly Family. He was part of Star's surrogate family when she transferred to Earth to study magic, and over time the two became romantically involved. While a bit of a scandal, Marco worked hard to earn a place with the royal family. He accompanied Star and the Butterfly family thoughout the numerous political crises that Mewni faced for the past years, starting with the Avarius conflict and through Toffee's attack and Mina's failed coup. He even officially became a knight of Mewni, though he sped through the years-long process in a few months due to his royal relationship. In all respects, he was an embedded friend of the Butterfly family, and if all went well he and Star might even get married. Unfortunately, due to the Cleaving, things wouldn't go well.\n\nWhen the Mewman Crisis occured, Marco was taken by a powerful cabal of nobles and was proclaimed king against his will. How he will navigate this position remains to be seen.\n\nMarco, who was born in pre-Cleaved California, believes in American ideals such as freedom, democratic rights, and more."
