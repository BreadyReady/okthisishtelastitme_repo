 CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_NAME:0 "The Mewman Crisis"
 CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_DESC:0 "Mewni has been expiriencing one crisis after another. The Cleaving occured right at the end of a coup by the Mewman-Supremacist Mina Loveberry. While Eclipsa was able to fight Mina off, the Cleaving still plunged the already unstable monarchy into utter chaos. In the following months various factions rose up in a bid to take the throne.\nNow, a little under a year after the cleaving, the lines of control have largely stabalized. Who will retunite Mewni remains to be seen..."
 
 MEW_CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_DESC:0 "Eclipsa Butterfly's royal rule has certainly seen better days. When the Cleaving began, she was the Queen of Mewni, matriarch of all Mewmanity. But in the months that followed, her control over the realm collapsed into the Mewman Crisis, and now she must contend to reunite Mewni.\n\nEmbroiled in this Mewni that shattered under her watch, will she manage to pick the pieces back up? Or will this mess ultimately consume her?"
 MON_CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_DESC:0 "Moon was one of the biggest driving factors in Eclipsa's control collapsing. A former queen and firm believer in both her own competence and Eclipsa's incompetence, Moon used her powerful connections and wide support among the royalty to contend for the throne. Unfortunately, instead of a clean coup, her actions led to shattered warlordism in the crownlands.\n\nBut in chaos, there is oppurtunity. Will Moon unite Mewni and guide it with a strong hand? Or will stronger, less elegant hands sieze power?"
 STA_CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_DESC:0 "As Moon's daughter, Moon decided to give Star her own duchy to manage as hands-on-training to prepare her as Moon's heir. While Star has been managing internal affairs just fine, her real concern is the state of the crownlands. With everyone wanting to unite the crownlands, everyone is at everyone's throats. The possibility of a big, bloody war is what keeps Star up at night as she tosses and turns thinking about how she could do to help everyone avoid it.\n\nThankfully, Star's cooked up a plan. Will she be the great diplomat? Or will she just be Moon's heir?"
 MAR_CALM_BEFORE_THE_STORM_DESC:0 "After Eclipsa's Mewni collapsed and the Mewman crisis began, Marco was taken by a cabal of lower nobles who proclaimed him King against his will. Marco, who was largely ignorant of the day-to-day inner workings of Mewman politics, was someone that that this cabal could comfortably manipulate and who was still somewhat related to the Butterfly Family.\n\nThrust into a a position of power he never wanted, many expect him to eventually be taken out of the picture. And yet, some wonder what exactly Marco's true hopes for the future are..."
